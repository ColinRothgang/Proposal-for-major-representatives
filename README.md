The main idea is to have a major representative for each (or
at least as many as possible) majors, which advises the AAC on matters
regarding that major (not necessary an AAC member, but invited to those
meetings). This representative also conducts a student organized major
specific round table, collects feedback forwards it to the QM, discusses
the problems and solutions in their major with their fellow students and
faculty and ultimately creates proposals to tackle those if necessary.
These proposals are then presented to the AAC by the representative,
discussed there and usually forwarded to the QM and/or pushed into the
AS/EAP.
This way the AAC can support majors in their fights to solve major
specific problems, without having to work them out itself (too much work, and 
most AAC members are not competent on major specific issues on the respective major).
