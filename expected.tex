As a consequence of the AAC not taking up (and sometimes not knowing about) major-specific issues, various majors have fought separately for themselves without the support of the ones who are supposed to represent us and have the connections into the relevant university committees. They, might not hear about each other and their experience is lost afterwards. 

Instead, one would expect that there should be a structured way the AAC can get qualified feedback from a major, should have somebody they can contact in case of questions and that the students of the major, have a way to directly communicate their feedback and suggestions into the AAC, without having to join the AAC, which many might not be willing to do. This would also (in the authors' opinion) make the AAC to large to be still effective.
