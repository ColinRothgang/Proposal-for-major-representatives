In the AAC meeting of May 3, 2018 when this proposal was initially discussed specifically amendment \ref{amend:1} and the aspect of the major representative informing the AAC, was criticized for reinventing the wheel, since this feedback is already gathered by the QM. 

However, amendment \ref{amend:1} is merely a way to assigning the task of organizing the round tables also discussed in that meeting, to a person responsible for each major and seems to be a natural choice, in case the AAC continues to organize these round tables. 
On the other hand, having a contact person in each major advising the AAC allows us to get feedback directly during a meeting. 

Another practical issue with this proposal is actually finding good major representatives. For the time being, current AAC members can find/serve as representatives for their major, but ultimately a proper selection procedure is needed and should be implemented until the beginning of next semester. This remains up for discussion.
