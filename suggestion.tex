The main idea is to create \emph{major representatives}, one student per major which can advise the AAC in matters regarding the major, represents the major to the AAC and the informs the major about (major relevant) developments in the AAC. 
The major representatives would also have the right to make (major specific) agenda points for the AAC to inform the AAC on problems inside of the major and to propose possible solutions (after discussing them with his fellow students and ideally faculty). Them would also usually be responsible for/involved  in any projects that specifically concern the major.

\subsection{Further optional amendments to the proposal}
Additionally, the authors would like to propose the following additional responsibilities of the major representative (or whoever them makes responsible):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  \phantomsection \label{amend:1} Organizing and reporting back from the student-organized round tables in the major
	\item \phantomsection \label{amend:2} Serve as contact person also towards other university committees (e.g. the QM)
	\item \phantomsection \label{amend:3} Being invited into the EAP or AS when needed, to advise our representatives in major-specific matters
\end{enumerate}
